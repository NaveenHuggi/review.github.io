        <h1>Introduction to Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h1>
        <p>
            The course "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" explores the fundamental concepts of algorithm development, efficiency, 
            and computational problem-solving. It delves into understanding how to design effective algorithms for a wide range of 
            computational tasks while analyzing their performance.
